TASK: build a google homepage

Earlier in the year I completed a introductory university level unit on software engineering and was required to build an app with JS, HTML and CSS. Because we relied on the MDL library, I had minimal experience fiddling with CSS. 

This project allowed me to get a closer look on how flex and grids work. I struggled for a long time with flex and so it required a lot of trial and error to arrange the links to the side of the webpage. Overall, I feel like I've honed on my CSS skills.

What I would do differently next time, instead of trial and error-ing blindly, I'd try to understand the issue wholly before aiming to fix the issue.
